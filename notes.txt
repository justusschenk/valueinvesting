Why is the correlation between the portfolio and the FF HML factor not 1?
A: Our B/M long-short portfolios are simple single sorts based on Fama-French’s (1992) 
univariate regression rather than the size-balanced 2 x 3 two-step constructions from 
Fama-French (1993). That is, FF 1993 form HML by (1) forming 6 portfolios by sorting on size 
and book-to-market and then (2) going long-short the extreme book-to-market portfolios with equal-weighting. 
Our code allows for this more complicated construction but we haven’t built it yet. Contributors are welcome! 
We have implemented this alternative construction and you can find those 2 x 3 portfolios here.
~from FAQ of openassetpricing


When the value style is in favor, assets flow in, returns are good, and value becomes 
expensive based on relative valuation. When the market tide turns, the opposite happens: 
funds flow out of value stocks, these flows generate negative price pressure, and value becomes 
relatively cheap as returns fall. If this holds, then, as we noted earlier, the falling relative 
valuation of value stocks versus growth stocks should be a temporary headwind.

July 2nd: 
- Following Adrei Goncalves in computing fundamental equity/ fundamentals-to-market ratio to compensate for 
  potentially outdated bookvalue-metric
- further analyse the return decomposition
    - investigate how each factor behaves in other models implemented only with long-short-returns to date
    - Analyze changes in return factors over time and find reasons for those changes
- compare the portfolio if financials are eliminated
